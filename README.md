(Preliminary DRAFT – Work in progress)

Background

Participating in or trading stocks in the stock market is a decision-based activity that relies heavily on current performance information and the prediction of future stock performance. Data is compiled daily for all active trading sessions Monday through Friday daily and yearly basis. Collected data consists of Opening Price, Lowest Price, Highest Price, Closing Price, Trading Volume and Stock Name.

Objective

The objective is to demonstrate the application of every key aspect of data analysis techniques working with Time Series Stock Data collected over a period of five years. The analysis provides answers to key performance index questions through classification using Neural Network and Deep Learning predictive algorithms.

Question to which answers are offered
•	Classification based on Return on Investment (4 Categories, 1,2,3,4)
•	Which stocks have 21-25% or higher annual ROI?
•	Which stocks have 15-20% annual ROI?
•	Which stocks have 10–15% annual ROI?
•	Which stocks have less than or equal to 10% annual ROI?
•	Prediction for the following year?
