Data is compiled daily for all active trading sessions Monday through Friday daily and yearly basis. Collected data consists of Opening Price, Lowest Price, Highest Price, Closing Price, Trading Volume and Stock Name.

Objective

The objective is to demonstrate the application of every key aspect of data analysis techniques working with Time Series Stock Data collected over a period of five years. The analysis provides answers to key performance index questions through classification using Neural Network and Deep Learning predictive algorithms.

Question to which answers are offered

•	Trend - Is there an upward or downward trend?
•	Pattern - Is there a pattern over a period of time?
•	Seasonality or Stationality?
